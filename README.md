# Introduction

This repo holds code that was used in one a project that I was involved with.
It took big amounts of stock data, compiled it and merged it in a reasonable
time with resources in mind.

# Usage

This code is not very useful on it's own as it needs the underlying data, which
are confidential. However, the code itself is free to use.
